# To do
This is a list of tools or resources that are in demand, but which currently do not exist or need to be significantly improved.

- [ ] Bayesian stratigraphic modelling in R
- [ ] Harris matrices R package
  - This is being worked on at [stratigraphr](https://github.com/joeroe/stratigraphr)
- [ ] TFQA (Tools for Quantitative Archaeology) development
- [ ] R packages for analysizng publication / professional metrics
- [ ] Software (maybe a command line tool or an R package) that shows astronomical relations if given a coordinate, a coordinate and an angle, or two coordinates in eyeshot. It should allow to get a quick estimation if a certain location or man made structure was build with respect to astronomical features as discussed in [Cultural Astronomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_astronomy). Despite the obvious problem that correlation does not mean causation, for some contexts, like for example ritual architecture in the European Metal Ages, astronomical obervations seemed to be very relevant. This software package should allow the user to get a quick overview about possible relations like solstices, lunistice, planet rises, etc..
